# US-Stock-Indexing-Web-Demo #
is a side project of my demo of an U.S. stock indexing website with MERN Stack using MongoDB, Express, ReactJS and NodeJS. It hosts financial and stock info for 500 listed US publicly traded companies. The data was from Yahoo Finance by using Python spider I've created.
